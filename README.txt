When raphaelPSO.py is run, a gif will be generated in addition to the shell output.

PSO.gif shows how the particles behave to find the minimum of the function.

Inside raphaelPSO.py there is a variable called n_particles, which represents the number of particles (or population) that will be used. It is interesting to vary this number and visualize the behavior in PSO.gif, if you wish.
